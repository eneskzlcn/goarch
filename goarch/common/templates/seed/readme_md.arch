### How To Use That Command

You can put below commands to your projects Makefile like;

- Migration:
    `go build -o migrate  ./seed/cmd/postgres  && ./migrate -type=migrate && rm -rf migrate`
- Drop:
    `go build -o drop  ./seed/cmd/postgres  && ./drop -type=drop && rm -rf drop`

The Makefile command I use for that commands are `make migrate` and `make drop`

Do not forget the set -type flag for your use purpose.
